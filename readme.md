# ⚖️ Fine-Tuned FLAN-T5 for Legal Document Summarization & NER

This project is a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for **summarizing legal documents** and performing **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). It features an interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**, supports both **PDF and plain text input**, and lets users **download results** for legal analysis or reporting.

## 📌 Project Overview

Legal documents are often long, dense, and filled with domain-specific language that general-purpose summarization models fail to handle well. This project addresses that by fine-tuning a large language model specifically for the **legal summarization domain** and pairing it with an **NER system** to identify people, organizations, laws, locations, and more.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 🔹 Base Model
- [`google/flan-t5-large`](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large) — a powerful encoder-decoder model pretrained using instruction tuning across diverse tasks.

### 🔹 Fine-tuned Model
- Model Name: `aun09/flan-t5-legal-summary`
- Hosted on Hugging Face: [View Model](https://huggingface.co/aun09/flan-t5-legal-summary)
- Fine-tuned on legal bill summaries to make it more accurate for law-related documents.

- **Use Case:** Legal bill summarization
- **Split:**  
  - Train: ~18,949 examples  
  - Test: ~3,269 examples  
- **Fields used:** `text`, `summary`

## 🧠 Why Fine-Tune a Legal Summarizer?

Generic LLMs struggle with:

- Legal jargon
- Structured contract language
- Long, nested clauses
- Section-specific relevance

By fine-tuning a model on real legal bill summaries (`FiscalNote/billsum`), we get:

- ✅ Better comprehension of legal syntax
- ✅ More faithful and concise summaries
- ✅ Increased relevance and context retention
- ✅ Domain-specific abstraction

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User uploads or pastes legal text**
2. `extract_text_from_pdf()` pulls clean text using `PyMuPDF`
3. `generate_summary()` sends the text to the Hugging Face-hosted fine-tuned model
4. `perform_ner()` runs spaCy NER pipeline on the same text
5. Streamlit displays both:
   - 📌 Summary
   - 🔍 Grouped entities by type
6. Option to download results as `.txt`
